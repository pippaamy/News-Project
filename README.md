## Cloning the repo

I have added the .env.* to the .gitignore so any future developers will need to add the .env.test and .env.development files in order to connect to the two databases locally. 

In order to create these files, you can click the add file button that comes up when you hover over the "BE-NC-NEWS" or create it within your terminal with the command  "touch" 

The two files need to say "PGDATABASE=" with the database you are wishing to connect to next to it. If you are wishing to connect to the test file it is the same as the development file but with "_test" added onto it.
